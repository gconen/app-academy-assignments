# ActiveRecordLite

The solo project for week 3, day 5 of App Academy. Implements some of the functionality of Rails ActiveRecord objects.

The provided exercise included all the specs that start with a number (00_attr_accessor_object.rb through 04_associatable2.rb), as well as the DBConnection interface object and the database itself. I wrote the implementations that met those specs, and both the spec and the logic for validateable.
